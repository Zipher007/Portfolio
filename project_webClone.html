      <p>
        Here's where you're at right now.<br /><br />You have a powerful message
        that you want to share with the world.<br /><br />You have a product or
        service that's successful and gets your customers results.<br /><br />But
        if your people are winning, why aren't you winning on a scale you're
        supposed to be winning?<br /><br />What's stopping you from getting the
        entire world to know you?
      </p>
      <p>
        Your problem is not that your funnel isn't working, you have low
        conversions, your positioning is off, your copy sucks, or that your
        service isn't valuable.
      </p>
      <p>
        Your #1 problem is obscurity. Your problem is getting the world to know
        you, your products, and your services.
      </p>
      <h2>It's time to stop competing and dominate your market.</h2>
      <p>But first, let me ask you a question.</p>

      <p>
        Look, you need to be in a place in your market where when someone has a
        need, you're the first and only person that should come to your
        potential customer's mind.
      </p>
      <p>
        Now the question is, how do you build that relationship with your
        audience where you're always the first person to come in their mind?
      </p>

      <p>You already know this, just saying it anyway.</p>
      <p>
        Now, here is what WILL work.<br />First you need a product or service
        that the world needs (you already got this part down).<br />Second, you
        need to build trust and authentic relationship with your audience.
      </p>
      <p>
        People like Gary Vee, Grant Cardone, Tony Robbins, or anyone else who's
        dominating their market, are dominating that market for one reason and
        one reason only. Trust.
      </p>
      <p>
        They've built businesses that will last the test of time. Even way after
        they die.
      </p>

      <p>
        That's the place I want you to be. In a place where you're the ONLY one
        who is the first and the right choice for your customer.
      </p>
      <p>
        Now, let's say we want to build an authentic connection with our
        audience and customers... How should we do it? The best way would be to
        meet these people in person. Face to face. Just you and them. They can
        see your passion, feel your energy, and get their questions answered.
        You can get them to see you as an authority, build a strong relationship
        with you, and they might even purchase your product or service on the
        spot.
      </p>
      <p>But...&nbsp;that might be a little difficult and harder to scale.</p>
      <p>
        Hmm... Okay let's try another way. Public speaking. When you speak on a
        stage in front of select audiences, there's nothing better than building
        authority, establishing a relationship, and growing your business. But,
        when your talk is over... It's over. If I wanted to share your message
        with someone, it wouldn't be very easy for me to do.
      </p>
      <p>
        Landing public speaking engagements at events like Converkit, T&amp;C,
        or Growthcon are already a difficult task and even if you can land them,
        there is only a limited number of them you can do. Also, your message is
        only limited to that room, instead of the whole world.
      </p>
      <p>
        Now what if you could build your authority, establish an authentic
        relationship with your audience, and sell more of what you have to your
        potential customers. And it doesn't matter what part of the world
        they're in.
      </p>
      <p>This is the power of video marketing.</p>
      <p>This is what I do.</p>
      <p>
        I help you build your authority, overcome obscurity, scale your
        business, and build an audience of ideal buyers for your products or
        services by leveraging the power of video marketing through YouTube.

        I help smart online marketers &amp; successful business owners who want
        to build trust with their audience and scale their business leveraging
        YouTube.

      <p>
        It's really weird that no-one is teaching this stuff. Most people are
        just teaching you how to get more subscribers, likes, and comments on
        YouTube with videos like "Learn how to get your first 1000 subscribers
        FAST in 2017".&nbsp;
      </p>

      <p>I also have a special gift for you.</p>
      <p>
        I want to show you behind the scenes on how I've leveraged YouTube to
        build a business from scratch that has generated over $450,000 in less
        than 15 months...
